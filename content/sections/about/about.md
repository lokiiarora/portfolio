Hey there! I'm Lokesh Raj Arora, a tech enthusiast with over 5 years in the software development game. I've got a flair for spicing up e-commerce and digital experiences with my coding skills. My toolkit includes JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and I love diving into 3D and augmented reality projects. I've made my mark at Flipkart, enhancing 3D asset consumption, and I've also been a part of Scapic's creative journey. Back in my college days at SRM University, I was already coding up a storm. In short, I'm all about turning code into captivating, interactive experiences!
